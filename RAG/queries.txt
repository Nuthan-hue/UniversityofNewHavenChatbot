Answer: Graduation courses typically refer to the programs of study that students pursue leading up to graduation from a university or college. These can include both undergraduate and graduate programs. 

Undergraduate courses are for students who have completed high school and are seeking a bachelor's degree. These programs aim to provide a broad education and prepare students for entry-level positions in various fields.

Graduate courses are for students who have already completed a bachelor's degree and are seeking advanced knowledge and skills in a specific area. These programs can lead to master's or doctoral degrees and are often more focused on research and specialized skills.
