Good academic standing means that you must not be on academic probation with the university. The requirements for good academic standing are described in the \u201cAcademic Regulations\u201d section of the undergraduate catalog. (see below for details) Students are required to maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) to be considered in good academic standing. Please refer to the Academic Regulations for additional information on this requirement or . Remedial courses are calculated in the number of credit hours for a student and in the student\u2019s cumulative grade point average. At all times throughout the students\u2019 enrollment, federal regulations require schools to ensure that students are successfully completing 67% of the credits they are attempting in order to stay on track for graduating on time. This is called \"pace\". To determine if you are meeting \u201cpace\u201d, divide the total number of credits you have successfully earned by the total number of credits you have attempted. Successful completion is defined as the receipt of a passing letter grade (A+ to D-) and does not include the receipt of an F (Failure), INC (Incomplete), DNA (Did Not Attend), W (Withdrawal), or U (Unsatisfactory). In addition to the 2 main components of SAP, financial aid eligibility is limited to accumulated attempted credit hours totaling no more than 150% of the published credit hours required to receive an undergraduate degree. This is your maximum timeframe for receiving financial aid. For example, a program that requires 120 credit hours x 1.5 = 180 maximum allowable credit hours attempted for financial aid eligibility. Every term that you are enrolled in school will be counted, even the terms when you do not receive financial aid. Transfer credits accepted by the university from other institutions will count as both hours attempted and hours completed towards the maximum credit hour limit. At the end of each spring term the Financial Aid Office will check your academic transcript to make sure you have achieved the required cumulative GPA, earned the required number of credits, maintained the appropriate pace, and are not on academic probation. If you do not meet the satisfactory academic progress requirements, you will not be eligible to receive federal or state financial aid for the next school year. Federal financial aid includes, but not limited to, federal Direct student loans, federal Direct parent loans, federal Pell and SEOG grants, and federal work study. The Financial Aid Office will mail a letter to each student who fails to maintain the minimum satisfactory academic progress requirements. The letter will detail the deficiencies and the steps for reinstating your financial aid eligibility.

It was created with a very special purpose: to educate and train the next generation of engineers, scientists, and leaders. ESUMS has maintained high standards since its opening, and students are set up for success with advanced courses in math and science. Students are accepted based on entry into a lottery, and class sizes are under 100. ESUMS holds a very diverse student body, with students from many towns around the New Haven area. The partnership between the University of New Haven and ESUMS is aimed at leveraging the strengths of the University in engineering, science and education to enhance the math, science and engineering programs at ESUMS and provide early exposure of ESUMS students to engineering and science. The engineering curriculum currently used at ESUMS is based on Project Lead the Way (PLTW), a national program that forms partnerships among public schools, higher education institutions and the private sector to increase the quantity and quality of engineers and engineering technologist graduates in the US. University of New Haven is the affiliate university for PLTW in the state of Connecticut providing teacher training, PLTW certification for CT schools, college credit for students, graduate college credit, and professional development for teachers, including those at ESUMS. Senior students graduating from ESUMS who meet the general admission criteria to become full-time undergraduate first-year students at the University of New Haven will be automatically awarded a minimum half-tuition scholarship to attend the University at the time of admission! Based on their application materials and cumulative high school grade point average, applicants with outstanding high school performance may, instead, be eligible for a 75-percent or 100-percent tuition scholarship to attend the University. The ESUMS-UNewHaven merit scholarship applies only to tuition. Please note that each admitted student is eligible for a maximum of one merit scholarship. The ESUMS-UNewHaven merit scholarships cannot be combined with any other University merit scholarship including but not limited to the Presidential, Distinguished Scholar, Charger Awards, or other partnership scholarships such as New Haven Promise or Higher Heights YEP.

        "text": "Charger Family Connection It is every parent\u2019s fear\u2014unspoken in many households, whispered in hushed tones in others. Your child is leaving for college soon, and the pressure is building. The dread consumes you\u2014the unknown looms. Finally, you can\u2019t take it anymore, and in the dark of night, you blurt it out: \u201cWhat if my baby flunks out?\u201d Misery loves company, and rest assured that you have plenty. Every parent is going through the same thing that you are. By Wesley Ammon Parents will do whatever it takes to help their child succeed. Here are a few tips to consider. Don\u2019t do it for them. One more time: Don\u2019t do it for them. The urge to help too much is strong, and you\u2019ve got to learn to resist. Don\u2019t pick your student\u2019s classes. Don\u2019t proofread their work. Don\u2019t read their university e-mail. Don\u2019t schedule their advising appointments. The student must learn how to function on campus, and this will never happen if your child knows that mommy or daddy will get it done for them. Instead of taking the lead role, help in a covert way. Study the campus website, review your orientation materials, and be aware of the services available. This way you can offer subtle guidance and, at the same time, teach your child to become a better student. Here are some practice scenarios you may encounter and how to handle them: Scenario: Your child asks you what classes they should take next semester. Solution: Every student has an academic advisor; suggest that the trained professional might be a better source of advice than you. Scenario: Your child complains that a calculus professor is \u201cway over their head.\u201d Solution: Suggest that they give the campus tutoring center a try. Scenario: Your child is confused about their choice of majors. Solution: Mention that the campus has a career services office that might be able to help. Scenario: Your child is stressed by upcoming exams. Solution: Encourage a trip to the campus counseling center. Avoid the urge to be a \u201chelicopter\u201d parent. In other words, don\u2019t hover over your child. We live in the age of instant communication. However, there is no need to remind your student of our technological advances each and every day. Resist the urge to call, text, and e-mail on a daily basis. Let the child breathe a little. Let your student call you. Remember, they miss you too. A few dos and don\u2019ts might be in order here. Do: send cards and letters, visit on occasion, and, of course, send money. Don\u2019t: arrive unannounced to tidy the dorm room, provide a daily wake-up call, or phone at midnight on a Saturday under the pretense that you just want to \u201cchat.\u201d You are still the parent, and it\u2019s OK to have expectations. Yes, your precious 18-year-old freshman is an adult now, but where is it written that your parenting days are over? You had rules and expectations when your student was in high school, and",

Bad behavior had consequences when the student lived under your roof, and it can have consequences now. What those consequences are should be made plain, perhaps even put in writing, prior to your child leaving home. Make it clear that you expect regular class attendance; that you expect the best effort the child can muster; and that you won\u2019t take a call from the dean of students regarding a disciplinary matter with a laugh and a smile. Remembering what it was like to be young, to be starting this great adventure, is a key ingredient in helping your child succeed. Parents today often refer to \u201ckids these days\u201d as though they are a new strain of the species. The learning environment has changed, but the freshmen of 2020 are the same as the freshmen of 1990. Your priorities needed adjustment when you were your child\u2019s age, so be patient as the process runs its course. Empathize, at least to a point, if your student tells you that \u201cpledging is taking so much time I can\u2019t study.\u201d Understand that what seems insignificant to a 45-year-old may be a very big deal to a youngster.

The University of New Haven does not issue conditional I-20s for students seeking F-1 visa status if they have only been granted \"Conditional Admission\". This means that if you have no TOEFL, IELTS, PTE or Duolingo test scores or if you have a low TOEFL score (below 75 IBT) or a low IELTS score (below 6.0) or a low PTE score (below 53) or a low Duolingo score (below 100), you can still apply to the undergraduate program of your choice at the University. If the Admissions Committee determines that your application meets all the requirements for admission except for the English language requirement, you will be granted a \"Conditional Acceptance\" also known as \"Conditional Admission\". Conditional Admission provides you with the assurance that once you meet the University's English language and financial requirements, you will receive a University of New Haven I-20 and you will be allowed to enroll and begin your academic classes at the University of New Haven.

As you and your student sit down together to look at college financing options, you can (and should) start with free money whenever possible; search out all the scholarships and grants you can find. But be prepared to add loans to the list of aid possibilities. It\u2019s true this type of aid is not free (your student will have to pay it back when they graduate), but the terms of many loan programs are quite favorable. Responsible borrowing for education is a great investment. Consider some of the primary sources of loans available to your student and your family. are the most common type of student loans, and everyone can participate. Students with financial need (as determined by the results of the FAFSA) are eligible for the subsidized Direct Loan program. For this type of loan, the government will pay the interest that accrues while the student is in school. Students who don\u2019t have financial need (as determined by the FAFSA) can still get a Direct Loan\u2014however their loan will be unsubsidized, meaning they are responsible for paying the interest that accrues while they\u2019re in school. Students with unsubsidized loans can choose to defer this interest and add it to the principal of the loan; however this will increase their payments once they graduate. So, how much can your student borrow? A first-year student can borrow up to $5,500 (up to $3,500 of which can be a subsidized loan, if they qualify). The loan limits increase for upperclass students: sophomores can borrow $6,500 (up to $4,500 subsidized); juniors and seniors can borrow $7,500 (up to $5,500 subsidized). Moreover, first-year independent students or dependent students whose parents are denied a PLUS loan (detailed below) can apply for an additional $4,000 in unsubsidized Direct Loans. The relatively low interest rates and favorable repayment terms of Direct Loans make this a good place to start borrowing. The for credit-worthy parents of dependent students is another option to help pay for your student\u2019s education. Parents may take advantage of this federal program to borrow all or any part of their student\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses that remain after other aid is deducted from the bill. If you aren't in a position to borrow or you feel that it is the responsibility of your student to do so, a might be an option. Many loans with a variety of terms exist in this category. Regardless of your student's borrowing needs, they should talk with the colleges they are considering about loan processing procedures and the particular programs and lenders most commonly used there. Be sure to educate yourself and your student about the options, limits, interest rates, and repayment plans so they can make the best choices for their future.

But, this scenario is more fantasy than reality for most families. To cope with the reality that your student\u2019s college bills will likely outweigh their income and assets, you\u2019ll need a solid financial plan, and that plan starts with filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Every college-bound student should complete the FAFSA, and it often falls to the parents to motivate students to complete this process. You and your student will answer a series of questions about your income and assets, and in the end you\u2019ll have a number known as Expected Family Contribution (EFC). This is the annual amount that the government expects you and your student to be able to pay toward a college education. If the Cost of Attendance (COA) at a school exceeds your EFC, your student will be eligible for need-based loans and/or grants. You and your student can file the FAFSA as early as October 1 for the following academic year, and you\u2019ll need to repeat the process each year. You should encourage your student to file the FAFSA even if you don\u2019t think they\u2019ll qualify for need-based aid. The unsubsidized Direct Loan program is available to students regardless of financial need, but your student can\u2019t qualify if they don\u2019t file the FAFSA. The more organized you are, the easier you\u2019ll find the FAFSA process to be. Here are some of the key pieces of information and documents you\u2019ll need: After filing the FAFSA, you\u2019ll receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) that contains your EFC. If you provided an e-mail address on the FAFSA, you\u2019ll receive the SAR by e-mail, or you can view it online. You can also elect to receive a copy of the SAR by mail. The SAR and EFC will be sent to the schools your student indicated on the FAFSA, and these schools will offer them financial aid packages based on this data.

If anyone other than your parents is sponsoring you, you should explain your special relationship with this person, who may be committing tens of thousands of dollars to your education. Provide solid evidence of your sponsor's finances. This assures the Consular Officer that adequate funds will be available throughout your four-year college program. If your sponsor's income is from several different sources (such as salary, contracts or consulting fees, a farm, rental property, investments), have the sponsor write a letter listing and documenting each source of income. , are your ties to home so strong that you will not want to remain permanently in the host country?

You're thinking about the courses you'll take, the people you'll meet, and the exciting things you'll do... and then your heart sinks when you hear your friends describe the complexities of getting a student visa. Suddenly, you're afraid: what if, after filling out forms and dreaming about your future, you can't get a visa? Well relax; you can get a visa. But there are two things you should do to increase your chances of a favorable decision: first, have all the required documentation; second, be prepared. You must have a valid I-20, which your college will send you after you have been admitted and after you have certified your available finances. When it arrives, check the following: : If your I-20 is valid, you're ready to apply for the visa. In order to issue your visa, the Consular Officer must be satisfied on three counts: Visa requirements differ from country to country, but generally host governments want assurances that you won't drop out of school or take a job illegally. How can you show that your sponsor is able to finance your education? Your chances are improved if your parents are sponsoring your education. If anyone other than your parents is sponsoring you, you should explain your special relationship with this person, who may be committing tens of thousands of dollars to your education. Provide solid evidence of your sponsor's finances. This assures the Consular Officer that adequate funds will be available throughout your four-year college program. If your sponsor's income is from several different sources (such as salary, contracts or consulting fees, a farm, rental property, investments), have the sponsor write a letter listing and documenting each source of income. Laws generally state that you must demonstrate sufficient economic, family, and social ties to your place of residence to ensure that your stay in the Americas will be temporary. If your application is refused, the Consular Officer is required to give you an explanation in writing. You do have the right to apply a second time, but if you reapply, make sure to prepare much more carefully. The Consular Officer will want to see fresh evidence sufficient to overcome the reasons for the first denial. If you have given careful thought to your educational goals and if you have reasonable career plans, you'll find the visa interview an opportunity to prove you're ready to take the next big step in your education and in your life: college in the Americas.",

Students may prepay their loans at any time without penalty or you may request a shorter repayment schedule.

The Loan \u201cServicer\u201d is a company that collects the payments from you as you are repaying your loans. Beginning with the 2010-2011 school year, there was a change in the federal student loan program. If you borrowed federal student loans prior to that year, you may end up having more than one Loan Servicer. This means each month you will receive bills from different companies requesting payment for that month for your federal student loans.

For more information about loan consolidation, please visit: . If you cannot pay the monthly amount requested by the Loan Servicer, you should contact the Loan Servicer ! If you do not make the requested payment, your status will become \u201cDelinquent\u201d and continued non-payment will lead to \u201cDefault\u201d. ! Defaulting means you will have \"bad credit\". \"Bad credit\" means: You may be able to request a Forbearance (a time period in which you do not make payments on your loans). Your Loan Servicer may also suggest that you change your Repayment Plan for your Federal Student Loans. There are loan Repayment Plans offered for Federal Student Loans that may lower the amount of your monthly payment.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security created STEM-designated programs to help employers address the shortage of qualified workers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math. STEM-designated programs are equipping students with the skill sets that are needed to fill the 3.5 million STEM jobs that experts estimate will be available by 2025. In addition, STEM-designated educational programs may enable international graduates to remain in the United States for an additional 24 months after graduation to receive training through work experience. For more details about the OPT and STEM-extension process, see the at the bottom of this page. STEM is an acronym that stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. To earn the STEM designation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security a program must feature at least 50 percent of its coursework in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or math. OPT stands for optional practical training and is a form of work authorization that, upon successful completion of their degree, allows an international student to remain in the United States to work in a field related to their degree of study for up to 12 months. International students who complete a STEM-designated degree may be eligible to apply for the STEM , which is an 24 months of work authorization. If a student successfully applies and is approved for post-OPT and then the OPT STEM extension, they may be granted up to 36 months of practical training in total.
